<p align="justify"> Math and Machine Learning (Bayesian Methods and Reinforcement Learning) are the
subjects which fascinate me the most. Occasionally I spend time reading/listening to
Physics/Astronomy lectures. I love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Linux
philosophy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source
Technologies</a>. </p>
