      <section>
	<p>I am currently a graduate student of Data Science at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, seeking to understand intelligence. I used to work in Data Sciences group at <a href="http://www.247-inc.com/">[24]7 Innovation Labs</a> as a Senior Data Engineer, and at <a href="http://xurmo.com/">Xurmo Technologies</a> as a Software Engineer during my previous years.

	<p>I am extremely passionate about Deep Learning, and its applications in Natural Language Processing. I love the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Linux philosophy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source Technologies</a>.</p>

	<p> When I'm bored, I scribble stuff at <a href="https://github.com/srjit">Github.</a>

	<p> You can also find me in <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/sreejith2904">Linkedin</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/darthMaul_Jr">Twitter.</a> </p>

	<h3>Projects: Recent </h3>

	<p>
	  <a href="https://github.com/srjit/lstm-sentence-similarity"><b>Quantifying Semantic Similarity of Sentences using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Nets</b></a> <br/>
	  Using vectorized representations from Glove embeddings, the deep LSTM network designed could classify semantically similar questions from the ones which are not. The network was trained on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 GPU and an accuracy of 83% was obtained.

	  <a href="https://github.com/srjit/fakenewschallange"><b>The Fake News Stance Classification</b></a> <br/>
	  We address the problem of identifying fake news from authentic ones as a classification task, trying to measure the degree of relatedness between the headline and the article in discrete levels called stances. The relatedness in our task was defined on four levels - namely agree, discuss, disagree, unrelated. With a number of handcrafted linguistic features along with distance features from vectorized (Word2Vec) fields (header and article), we were able to obtain a maximum classification accuracy ~88%. Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and XGBoost algorithms were used for performance comparison.
